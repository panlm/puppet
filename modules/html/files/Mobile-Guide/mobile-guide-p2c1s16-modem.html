>&#13;   There are three kinds of modems available: internal,
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> card or external serial port modems. But
   some internal modems will not work with Linux these modems are usually
   called WinModem. This is caused by non-standard hardware. So you have to use either a
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> card modem or an external modem (serial or USB). The 
   <A
HREF="http://walbran.org/sean/linux/linmodem-howto.html"

>LinModem-HOWTO</A

   by Sean Walbran provides a detailed instruction how to deal 
   with these kind of modems. My pages about

   provide a survey about the modem controllers used in different laptops.
</P

>&#13;   Quotation from the Kernel-FAQ: "9.Why aren't WinModems supported? (REG,
   quoting Edward S. Marshall) The problem is the lack of specifications
   for this hardware. Most companies producing so-called
   <EM
>WinModems</EM
> refuse to provide specifications which
   would allow non-Microsoft operating systems to use them. The basic
   issue is that they don't work like a traditional modem; they don't
   have a DSP, and make the CPU do all the work. Hence, you can't talk
   to them like a traditional modem, and you -need- to run the modem
   driver as a realtime task, or you'll have serious data loss issues
   under any kind of load. They're simply a poor design."
</P
><P
>&#13;   "<EM
>Win</EM
> modems are lobotomized modems which expect
   Windows to do some of their thinking for them. If you do not have
   Windows, you do not have a connection. "
</P
><P
>&#13;   Anyway, I have set up a page collecting information on laptops with internal modems at 
   <A
HREF="http://tuxmobil.org/hardware.html"
TARGET="_top"
>TuxMobil - Hardware</A
>
   . Maybe it's possible to run such modems with MS-Windows9x/NT 
   emulators like <B
CLASS="command"
>wine</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>VMware</B
>, but I don't know it.

   are more or less the standard as to whether a modem is
   real or not, and also contain directions to getting drivers for the few
   winmodems that do have Linux drivers.

>&#13;   Pay attention to the different kinds of phone lines: analog and ISDN.
   You can't connect an analog modem to an ISDN port and vice versa. Though
   there might be hybrid modems available. Connecting to the wrong port may
   even destroy your modem. Trick: If you are looking for an analog phone
   port in an office building which is usually wired with ISDN, take a look
   at the fax lines, they are often analog lines.

>&#13;   If your machine features an internal modem as well as an internal
   ethernet card, pay also attention to plug the right cable into the plug.
   Otherwise you may damage your hardware easily. It may even cause a fire.

   Or <B
