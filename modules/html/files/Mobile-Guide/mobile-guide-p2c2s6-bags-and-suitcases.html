>&#13;   You probably wonder, why I include this topic here. But shortly after
   using my COMPAQ Armada 1592DT I recognized that the rear side of the
   machine (where the ports are arranged) was slightly damaged. Though I
   have taken much care when transporting the laptop, this was caused by
   putting the bag on the floor. It seems that the laptop has so much
   weight, that it bounces inside the bag on its own rear side. So I
   decided to put a soft pad into the bag before loading the laptop. A good
   bag is highly recommended if you take your laptop on trips, or take it
   home every night.

>&#13;   Laptops computers are frequently demolished in their carrying bag. The
   two main causes of demolition are poking the LC display and banging the
   edges. A good case has very stiff sides to spread out pokes, and lots of
   energy-absorbent padding around the edges to help when you whack it on
   the door jamb. Few cases actually have either of these features.

>&#13;   More laptops are lost to theft than damage, so camouflage is a wise too.

> The one I use has a microwavable heating pad in it - while I
   don't actually heat this pad (it's meant to keep food warm while in
   transport), it does provide padding underneath the laptop.  The carrier
   I have only has a lower  - heating - pad, but there is also a similar
   carrier that has both a lower  - heating - pad and an upper  - cooling -
   pad - placed in the freezer to get it cold - -- the intent is that you
   keep one or the other in the bag to keep your food hot or cold as
   desired.  A secondary advantage to the  - cooling pad - pad is that if
   you've  - chilled - it before taking the computer out for the day, it
   will keep the CPU cooler while you're running the laptop...

>&#13;   when it's left - unattended -  in a car, it's less likely to be stolen -
   think about it, if you were a thief walking through a parking lot and
   eyeing the contents of cars, a  - laptop bag -  is instantly
   recognizable as holding a laptop computer - something that can be fenced
   at a pretty hefty profit, but if you saw a casserole carrier in the
   front seat of a car, would you think it contained anything OTHER than a
   casserole? - and probably half-eaten, at that... - Unless you are a
   hungry thief, chances are you'll skip this and move on.
