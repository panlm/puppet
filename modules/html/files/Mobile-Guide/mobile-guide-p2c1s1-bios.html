>12.2. BIOS</H1

>&#13;   Before setting up any hardware you should have a look into the BIOS.
   Often you may find a solution already there, e.g. options to set up 
   the display,
   APM or ACPI,
   DMA,
   IrDA,
   PCMCIA,
   sound,
   SpeedStep,
   and more.



</P
><P
>&#13;   If you run into unresolvable trouble when configuring the hardware,
   try a BIOS upgrade from the manufacturer. For this task you
   usually need one of the Microsoft so-called operating systems. Or
   at least a DOS disk or CD.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Flashing BIOSes has become often quite complex as both DOS and floppies
   are fading away. Things aren't any easier when running exclusively
   GNU/Linux. Luckily, it is possible to 
   <A

   with GNU/Linux, which enables one to actually flash a BIOS using a DOS utility
   without requiring Windows, MS-DOS or a floppy drive.

   is able to update itself.

   from Linux (or another Unix) when one has no floppy drive and no access to a

   aims to replace the normal BIOS found on PCs, Alphas, and
   other machines with a Linux kernel that can boot Linux from a cold
   start. LinuxBIOS is primarily Linux - about 10 lines of patches to the
   current Linux kernel.  Additionally, the startup code - about 500
   lines of assembly and 5000 lines of C - executes 16 instructions to
   get into 32-bit mode and then performs DRAM and other hardware
   initialization required before Linux can take over. There are
   even two reports about LinuxBIOS on laptops.

   reports information about your system's hardware as described in
   your system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard (see a sample
   output). This information typically includes system manufacturer, model
   name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other
   details of varying level of interest and reliability depending on the
   manufacturer. This will often include usage status for the CPU sockets,
   expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the list
   of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB).

   is a cross-platform library intended to be used to obtain
   common information available in a BIOS using a unified API. Currently, it
   can programmatically access any information in the SMBIOS tables. It also
   has the ability to obtain Dell system-specific information such as the
   Dell System ID number, service tag, and asset tag. Future plans include
   APIs for $PIR and mptable mapping. There is a C API for some of the more
   commonly used functions, and example binaries to show off most of the
   facilities.
