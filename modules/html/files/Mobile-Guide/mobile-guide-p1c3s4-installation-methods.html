   : "Installing and using Linux on a laptop is
   usually no problem at all, so go ahead and give it a try. Unlike some
   other operating systems, Linux still supports and runs well on even very
   old hardware, so you might give your outdated portable a new purpose in
   life by installing Linux on it." 
</P

>&#13;   One of the great benefits of Linux are its numerous and flexible
   installation features, which I don't want to describe in detail. Instead
   I try to focus on <EM

   are necessary only in certain circumstances.
</P

   for laptops, including installation from CD-ROM/DVD, via
   <SPAN

   documents which are provided with these distributions for further

>3.4.1. From a Boot Floppy plus CD/DVD-ROM - The Traditional Way</H2
><P
>&#13;   With modern laptops, the traditional Linux installation 
   method (from one boot floppy, one support
   floppy and a package of CD-ROMs or one DVD) should be no problem, if there
   is a floppy drive and a CD-ROM drive available. Though with certain laptops
   you might get trouble, if you can not use
   <EM

> simultaneously,
   or if the floppy drive is <EM
>only available as a <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"

   device</EM
>, as with the Toshiba Libretto 100. Some laptops
   support also booting and therefore installation completely from a CD
   drive, as reported for the SONY VAIO in the 
   <A

   distribution comes on a bootable CD.
</P

   <EM

   with the <SPAN

>&#13;   You need two machines equipped with Linux. With the laptop
   (client/destination) on which you want to install Linux use the muLinux
   floppy. The other machine (server/source) may be a usual Linux box or
   also using muLinux. Though its low transfer rate I use a serial null
   modem cable because its cheap. You may apply the appropriate method
   using a <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> network card and a crossover network
   cable or a HUB, or a parallel "null modem" cable and PLIP. As the basic
   protocol I used PPP, but you may also use SLIP. For the data-transfer I
   used <B
CLASS="command"
>nc</B

   <B

>3.4.5. From a Second (Desktop) Machine With a Hard Disk Adapter</H2
><P
>&#13;   From Adam Sulmicki &#60;adam_AT_cfar.unc.edu&#62; I got this hint: Most but not
   all harddisks in laptops are removable, but this might be not an easy
   task. You could just buy one of those cheap 2.5" IDE converters/adapters
   which allow you to connect this harddisk temporarily to a desktop PC with IDE
   subsystem, and install Linux as usual using that PC. You may do so using
   the harddisk as the first IDE drive or besides as the second IDE drive.
   But then you need to be sure that the bootloader (e.g.
   <B
CLASS="command"
>lilo</B
>)
   writes to the right partition.
   Also you have to make sure that you use the same translation style as
   your laptop is going to use (i.e. LBA vs. LARGE vs. CHS ). 
   You will find additional information in the 
   <A
HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Hard-Disk-Upgrade/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Hard-Disk-Upgrade-HOWTO</A
>. 
   You might copy an existing partition, but it is also possible to achieve a
   customized installation. Instead of a desktop PC you may use a
   second laptop, which may offer better features like a CD/DVD, to put the harddisk in.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The most common adapter formats are 2.5" IDE adapters (Parallel ATA - PATA). As
   far as I know Serial ATA (SATA) harddisks are not available for laptops
   yet. But they could be attached to Serial ATA interfaces in a desktop PC
   even without an adapter (at least I guess, but I will verify this as soon
   as I have SATA equipment available). Some small subnotebooks feature
   1.8" harddisks with ZIF connectors. These connectors are ATA compatible,
   and IDE adaptors for them are available also.

   Linux doesn't recognize the same drive anymore so that you can't install

</P
><P
>&#13;   From Jeremy Impson &#60;jdimpson_AT_acm.org&#62;: I installed Red Hat 6.1
   on a Libretto 50CT. It only has a PCMCIA floppy drive. (Which BTW isn't
   well supported by the default PCMCIA floppy driver. I needed to download
   a patch from some Linux on Libretto web site.)
</P
><P
>&#13;   Linux will boot off the PCMCIA floppy drive, however. It just can't go
   back to the floppy after loading the kernel. My Libretto (the 50CT) only
   has one PCMCIA slot (later models had two slots, or I could have gotten
   the enhanced port replicator, which gave it another slot). So I couldn't
   boot off a floppy and then mount a remote filesystem.
</P
><P
>&#13;   So I downloaded ZipSlack (Slackware designed for running from a ZIP
   disk) and used another PC to load it onto a ZIP disk. I attached the ZIP
   drive to the Libretto (via the parallel port on the regular port
   replicator that comes with it) and booted from the Slackware boot disk
   in the PCMCIA floppy drive. When booted, I removed the floppy drive and
   inserted and configured a network PCMCIA card. At this point the kernel
   is in memory and it is using the filesystem on the ZIP disk.
</P
><P
>&#13;   I partitioned and formatted the Libretto's harddrive and then ftp'd Red
   Hat 6.1 installation source onto one of the new partitions (the
   partition that would become <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
> when everything
   gets done). This is the key: if you don't have enough disk space to have
   the installation files plus enough to actually install the OS on to,
   this method won't work.
</P
><P
>&#13;   I shut down the ZipSlack kernel and rebooted it using a RedHat install
   disk in the floppy drive. I pointed it at the RH6.1 installation media
   already on the harddrive and started the install.

>3.4.8. From a Parallel Port CD Drive (MicroSolutions BackPack)</H2
><P
>&#13;   I had tried myself to install Linux using the MicroSolutions BackPack
   parallel CD-ROM drive. It is fully supported by Linux and I haven't had
   any major problem running it. Until version 2.0.36 it is supported by
   its own module (<B
CLASS="command"
>bpck</B
>) while in later versions it
   has been merged in the more general parallel port ide adaptors (the
   <B
CLASS="command"
>paride</B
> module that relays then of course on more
   specific low level drivers, which in the BackPack case is still called
   <B
CLASS="command"
>bpck</B
>). 
</P
><P
>&#13;   In RedHat 5.x based installations the <B
CLASS="command"
>bpck</B
> module is
   available already at installation stage so you'll just have to select
   the BackPack cdrom from the <EM
>Other CD-ROMs</EM
> at the
   installation stage and then give it some more options (but
   <B
CLASS="command"
>autoprobe</B
> should work just fine).
</P
><P
>&#13;   In RedHat 6.x (which uses 2.2.x kernels and should then use 
   <B
CLASS="command"
>paride</B
>), the BackPack support was dropped. So to
   install the distribution from such a device, you will have to customize the
   bootdisk (adding the necessary modules) and the installation will be
   done without any problem.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Federico Pellegrin has customized a RedHat bootdisk that includes all the
   parallel CDROM devices that are supported by the distribution Linux
   kernel version (2.2.12) that should then work on all the supported
   parallel CDROM devices (even if he only tested it on his MicroSolutions
   BackPack since he doesn't have other similar hardware). You can find
   <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sole.infis.univ.trieste.it/~drzeus/rh_pcd.html"
TARGET="_top"
>some information on it and the bootdisk image</A
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;   As from RedHat 6.2 a supplementary driver disk was included in the
   distribution to support the paride devices. You'll just have to create
   the driver disk (the image file is <B
CLASS="command"
>paride.img</B
> and can
   be found in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>images/drivers</TT
> directory) in the
   usual way and insert it when the installer will ask for it.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Of course I suppose there isn't any problem in installing any other
   Linux distribution using such a device as long as you can add and
   configure the appropriate modules at the very beginning of the
   installation stage, but I haven't tested any.
</P
><P
>&#13;   You should take care of the mode the parallel port uses (ECP, EPP,
   Output only, PS/2) since some of them may cause your laptop to suddenly
   freeze or cause serious data corruption. On the other side some modes
   make the communication dramatically slow (I found the best choice on my
   laptop the PS/2, but you should make some tests).

>&#13;   I got this courtesy by Nathan Myers &#60;ncm_AT_cantrip.org&#62;: "Many

You have to prepare the source machine accordingly (instructions how
