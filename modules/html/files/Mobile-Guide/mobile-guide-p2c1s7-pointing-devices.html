   Most of the mice used in laptops are PS/2 mice (actually I
   don't know one with another mouse protocol). You may
   communicate with the PS/2 mouse through
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/psaux</TT
> or
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/psmouse</TT
>. If you use X Windows
   this device and the protocol has to be set in
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/X11/XF86Config</TT
>. In earlier
   releases, sometimes the GPM mouse manager and X Windows had
   trouble sharing a mouse when enabled at the same time. But
   as far as I know this is no problem anymore for the latest
   versions.

   touchpad).
</P

><LI
><P
>&#13;   if the finger moves close to an edge then the mouse motion will be
   continued in that direction so that you don't need to pick up your

>&#13;   It seems <B

   This is true, but you may use it as an X11 input device.
   <B
CLASS="command"
>gpm</B
> is used as a repeater device. In this way you can
   use both the built-in synaptics touchpad with all the features and at
   the same time a serial mouse (with three buttons). This all works
   smoothly together. X11 reads the mouse events from a named pipe
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/gpmdata</TT
> in a protocol it understands, which in
   my case is <EM
>Mouse-Systems-Compatible</EM
> (5bytes). Most
   3-button mice use the default protocol. So a simple reconfiguration in
   XF86Config is all that is required, after starting
   <B

>gpm</B

</P

   and X11 mode. You do have to create the named pipe

   with information received from a HID device, or where the information
   that is sent to a device comes from, since this is obviously dependent
   on what the device is supposed to be doing, and what the operating
   system is. Linux (at the operating system kernel level) supports four
   interfaces to a HID device - keyboard, mouse, joystick and a generic
   interface, known as the event interface.

   Perform the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are

   <TT

>&#13;   Plug in a <SPAN

   been correctly sensed by the kernel. If you don't have a kernel message,
   look for the changes to <TT

</P
><P
>&#13;   Since <SPAN

>USB</SPAN

   can have multiple mice plugged in. You can get each mouse seperately, or
   you can get them all mixed together. You almost always want the mixed
   version, and that is what will be used together. You need to set up a
   device node entry for the mixed mice. It is customary to create the
   entries for this device in the /dev/input/ directory.

   mice) on /dev/input/mice, then the following <B

   command would probably be appropriate: <B
CLASS="command"
>gpm -m /dev/input/mice
   -t imps2 -M -m /dev/psaux -t ps2 -R imps2</B
>. Note that this will
   make the output appear on <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/gpmdata</TT
>, which is a
   FIFO and does not need to be created in advance. You can use this as the
   mouse "device" to non-X programs, and both mice will work together.
