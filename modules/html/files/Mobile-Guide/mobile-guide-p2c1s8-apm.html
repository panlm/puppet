   This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have

   Though the default seems to be Y. So it may be enabled if you are
   unaware.
   I have got reports that SMP support enabled does interfere with APM.
   So with a single CPU machine like a laptop you are on the save side,

>&#13;   From the apmsleep(1) man page: Some computers, especially laptops,
   can wake up from a low-power suspend to DRAM mode using the Real-time clock

   into suspend or standby mode. An  interrupt  from  the  RTC  causes the
   computer to wake-up.  The program detects this event, by waiting for a
   leap  in  the kernel  time  and terminates successfully. If no time leap
   occurs within one minute, or something  goes wrong, the exit value will
   be non-zero. Apmsleep is part of the <B

   enables the possibility of suspending a machine. It doesn't need APM.
   You may suspend your machine by either pressing Sysrq-d or with

CLASS="command"

CLASS="command"
>shutdown -z</B
> (patch for

   saved in your active swaps. By the next booting the kernel detects the
   saved image, restores the memory from it and then it continues to run
   as before you've suspended. If you don't want the previous state to
   continue use the <B

</P
><P
>&#13;   Software suspends may even be better than hibernate, because now I can
   suspend my Linux system, boot into Microsoft Windows, perform a few
   illegal operations and be shut down, and then restart my Linux setup
   exactly where I left off! This is something that cannot be done with
   hibernation, since that always restores the last state that you
   suspended from, be it Microsoft Windows or Linux. So if I want to switch
   to Microsoft Windows to play games or do anything else, I can leave my
   Linux desktop exactly as it is and return to how I left it.
