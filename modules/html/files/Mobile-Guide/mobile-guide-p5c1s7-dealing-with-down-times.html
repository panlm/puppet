><P
>&#13;   A cron-like program that doesn't go by time: <B
CLASS="command"
>anacron</B
>
   (like "anac(h)ronistic") is a periodic command scheduler. It executes
   commands at intervals specified in days. Unlike <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
>,
   it does not assume that the system is running continuously. It can
   therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and monthly
   jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that don't run 24
   hours a day. When installed and configured properly,
   <B
CLASS="command"
>anacron</B
> will make sure that the commands are run at
   the specified intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.

>hc-cron</A
>
   is a modified version of Paul
   Vixie's widely used <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
>
   daemon. Like the original program it runs specified jobs at periodic
   intervals. However, the original <B
CLASS="command"
>crond</B
> relies on the
   computer running continuously, otherwise jobs will be missed. This
   problem is addressed by <B
CLASS="command"
>hc-cron</B
>, that is indended for
   use on <EM
>home-computers</EM
> that are typically turned off
   several times a day; <B
CLASS="command"
>hc-cron</B
> will remember the time
   when it was shut down and catch up jobs that have occurred during down
   time when it is started again.
