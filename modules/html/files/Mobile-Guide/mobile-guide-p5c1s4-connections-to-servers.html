>15.6. Connections to Servers</H1
><P
>&#13;   From Dirk Janssen &#60;dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu&#62;: Here are several good
   ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a
   separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a
   terminal server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and
   the better keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The
   easiest way to do this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from
   your desktop (running X) to the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure
   connection and, crucially, a secure X connection between the two
   machines. If you type, for example, <B
CLASS="command"
>emacs &#38;</B
> in
   the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while
   running on your laptop. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   There are various ways in which you can make this situation more
   productive/complicated. Emacs, for one thing, can open windows (called
   frames by emacs) on separate displays by using
   <B
CLASS="command"
>make-frame-on-display</B
>. This way, you can have the
   same emacs displaying on your desktop and your laptop: A dual headed
   system is born. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   For other programs, you usually have to decide at startup time on which
   screen you want them. To run them on the laptop screen, start them as
   usual. To run them on the desktop screen, start them from the ssh shell
   on the desktop or redirect their screens using the DISPLAY variable.
   Some programs also accept a <B
CLASS="command"
>-display</B
> option. Read the
   documentation on <B
CLASS="command"
>xauth</B
> on how to set this up. An easy
   way out is to find out which pseudo display ssh has created for you by
   typing <B
CLASS="command"
>echo $DISPLAY</B
> in the ssh shell. Assuming your
   desktop is called <B
CLASS="command"
>olli</B
> and your laptop
   <B
CLASS="command"
>stan</B
>, this will usually produce something like
   <B
CLASS="command"
>stan:10</B
>. This means that processes on stan (the
   laptop) display on what they think is the 10th screen of stan, which by
   some ssh magic is actually relayed (in a secure way) to the screen of
   olli.
</P
><P
>&#13;   There are some ways in which you can dynamically move windows from one
   machine to another. A very interesting approach is taken by
   <B
CLASS="command"
>xmove</B
>, but this program lacks a good user interface
   (any volunteers?). Xmove creates a pseudo screen (similar to the stan:10
   that ssh creates) and windows that have their DISPLAY set to this pseudo
   screen can be moved back and forth between real screens (provided all
   screens use the same color depth).
</P
><P
>&#13;   Alternatively, you can run an one of the several programs that open a
   <B
CLASS="command"
>virtual root window</B
>: A window on your desktop that
   contains other windows. It looks a lot like running an emulator. With
   these programs, you can start your processes on stan, then move all
   their windows to olli, then work for a while, and then move them back so
   you can continue working on stan. Hibernate your laptop and repeat ad
   infinitum. Check out xmx and VNC for this. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   If this is all too complicated for you, but you like to use the two
   screens at the same time, consider at least installing x2x. This little
   tool makes it possible to move your mouse from one screen to the other,
   and the keyboard focus goes with it. To run it, you need another ssh
   going from stan (the laptop) to olli (the desktop): ie. type
   <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh olli</B
> in a stan xterm. Keep this shell running and
   find out which pseudo screen was created with <B
CLASS="command"
>echo
   $DISPLAY</B
>. This will return something like
   <B
CLASS="command"
>olli:10</B
> (see above for explanation). Now, type this
   in any shell on olli: <B
CLASS="command"
>x2x -west -to olli:10</B
> (and I
   mean, in a shell that runs on olli and displays on olli, not an ssh
   shell) This creates a little black band to on the left (west) side of
   your desktop's screen. Whenever you move the mouse over this, the mouse
   on screen olli:10 will move. Because olli:10 is just an ssh-created
   alias for the screen of stan, the mouse on your laptop will move and you
   can type there by only moving your head, not your hands.
</P
><P
>&#13;   A note on X-security: Playing around with various screen programs is
   much easier if you issue an <B
CLASS="command"
>xhost +</B
> on either
   computer. But this is extremely unsafe. Do this only when you are not
   connected to any larger network. If you have everything working, spend
   some time on getting xauth to work. If you use xdm, it is usually easy.
   Otherwise, consider starting your Xserver with the same magic cookie all
   the time. This is less safe, but still pretty safe, and it means that
   you have to copy the cookies only once. Check the startup scripts
   (.xserverrc, .xinitrc, .xsession, etc) for something like
   <B
CLASS="command"
>cookie="MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 `keygen`"</B
> and change that
   into (invent your own cookie here): <B
CLASS="command"
>cookie="MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
   12345678901234567890abcdefabcdef"</B
>
