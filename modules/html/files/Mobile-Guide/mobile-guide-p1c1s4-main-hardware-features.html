   Laptops with <EM

   Active matrix
   displays have better color and contrast, but usually cost
   more and use more power. Also consider the screen size.
   Laptops may be purchased with screens up to 17". A bigger
   screen weighs more, costs more, and is harder to carry,
   but is good for a portable desktop replacement.

   same time as the PowerBooks, they were a sort of subnotebook, but were
   designed so that you could plug them into a base station (a DuoDock)
   with more RAM, peripherals, etcetera, so that they could also act as a
   desktop computer. The first PowerPC PowerBooks were the ill-starred
   PowerBook 5300 (after the 190) and the Duo 2300c.

   different setups that can be very hard to figure out.  Also, because of
   a general lack of machines to test, we are only aware of boots on the
   Powerbook 145, Powerbook 150, Powerbook 170, Powerbook 180, and
   Powerbook 190. Even if it boots, we currently have no support for
   Powerbook-style ADB, the <SPAN

   anything else on them. This means the only way to log in is with a
   terminal hooked up to the serial interface, this has been tested on the

   <SPAN

   supply the necessary hardware information to write a driver. As always,
   an FPU is needed also. Many of the later models have the 68LC040
   processor without FPU, and many of these processors are broken with
   respect to the FPU trap mechanism so they can't run regular Linux
   binaries even with FPU emulation. Current status on Powerbooks 140, 160,
   165, 165c, 180c, 190, 520 and Duos 210, 230, 250, 270c, 280, and 280c is

>&#13;   As far as I know Amiga has never produced laptops. One company

>&#13;   At higher speed, a CPU consumes more power and generates more heat.
   Therefore, in many laptops a special low-power CPU is used.
   Usually, this special CPU doesn't use as much power as a similar
   processor used in a desktop. These special CPUs are also more expensive.
   As a side effect you may find that laptops with a desktop CPU often have
   a quite noisy fan.

>&#13;   An enormously important issue.  Anything based on PPC or Pentium will
   generate enormous amounts of heat which must be dissipated. Generally,
   this means either a fan, or a heat sink the size of the case. If it's a
   fan, the air path shouldn't get blocked, or it will overheat
   and burn out. This means machines with a fan mounted in the bottom are a
   big, big mistake: you can't use them on a soft surface.

   capabilities). So you may decide between a brand or no-name product.
   Though I would like to encourage you to take a
   <EM
>no-name</EM
> product, there are some caveats. I have
   experienced that laptops break often, so you are better off, when you
   have an after-sales warranty, which is usually only offered with brand
   products. Or you may decide to take a <EM
>second hand</EM
>
   machine. When I tried this, I discovered that the laptop market is
   changing quite often.  A new generation is released approximately every
   three months (compared by CPU speed, harddisk capacity, screen size
   etc.). So laptops become old very quick. But this scheme often isn't
   followed by the prices for second hand laptops. They seem too expensive
   to me. Anyway if you plan on purchasing a second hand machine, review my
   recommendations on checking the machine.
