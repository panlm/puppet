>12.11.1. Linux Compatibility Check</H2
><P
>&#13;


   Usually there are no problems with Linux and the keyboard.
   Though there are two minor caveats: First the
   <B
CLASS="command"
>setleds</B
> program might not work. Second the
   key mapping might not fit your needs. Some
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>UNIX</SPAN
> users and <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> users
   expect to find the &#60;CONTROL&#62; key to the left of the
   &#60;A&#62; key. Many PC-type keyboards have the
   &#60;CAPS-LOCK&#62; key there. You may use
   <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>loadkeys</B
> to
   re-map the keyboard. Some laptops (e.g., Toshiba) allow you
   to swap the &#60;CAPS-LOCK&#62; and &#60;CONTROL&#62; keys. Mark
   Alexander offered this solution in the linux-laptop mailing
   list: On RedHat, it's a one-line patch to
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map</TT
> , or
   whatever file is referenced in
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</TT
>:

>&#13;   A second (or external) keyboard can be attached using the
   PS/2 port (I suppose this is not possible via the serial
   port, since there is no keyboard controller for the serial
   port) or via USB port. 
   Also there is one laptop with a detachable keyboard
   the Siemens Scenic Mobile 800. This machine uses an
   infrared connection to the keyboard, but I don't know
   whether this works with Linux.

>&#13;   You may not need any operating system support at all to use a
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> keyboard if you have a PC architecture. There are
   several <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIOS</SPAN
> available where the
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIOS</SPAN
> can provide <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> support from
   a keyboard plugged into the root hub on the motherboard. This may or may
   not work through other hubs and does not normally work with add-in
   boards, so you might want to add in support anyway. You definitely want
   to add keyboard support if you activate operating system support, as the
   Linux <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> support will disable the
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIOS</SPAN
> support. You also need to use Linux
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> keyboard support if you want to use any of the
   "multimedia" types keys that are provided with some
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> keyboards.
</P
><P
>&#13;   In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> Human Interface Device (HID) support and Keyboard
   support. Do not turn on <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> HIDBP Keyboard support.
   Perform the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are
   installing as modules, you need to load the hid.o, input.o and keybdev.o
   modules.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Check the kernel logs to ensure that your keyboard is being correctly
   sensed by the kernel.
</P
><P
>&#13;   At this point, you should be able to use your <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
>
   keyboard as a normal keyboard. Be aware that LILO is not
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> aware, and that unless your
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIOS</SPAN
> supports a legacy <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> keyboard, you
   may not be able to select a non-default boot image using the
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> keyboard. I have personally used a
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN
> keyboard (and <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN

   experienced no problems.

   In some cases one kbd port and one aux port is not enough and you may
   want to add another keyboard or mouse. You can use this adapter,
   together with the <B

   to be plugged in; on others it doesn't work at all. If you
   want to use both, you better check that it works.
