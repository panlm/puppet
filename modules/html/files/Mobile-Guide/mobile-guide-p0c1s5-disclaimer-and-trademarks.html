>&#13;   This is free documentation. It is distributed in the hope that it will
   be useful, but without any warranty. The information in this document is
   correct to the best of my knowledge, but there's a always a chance I've
   made some mistakes, so don't follow everything too blindly, especially
   if it seems wrong. Nothing here should have a detrimental effect on your
   computer, but just in case,  I take no responsibility for any damages
   incurred from the use of the information contained herein.

>&#13;   Some laptop manufacturers don't like to see a broken laptop with an
   operating system other than the one shipped with it, and may reload
   MS-Windows if you complain of a hardware problem. They may even declare
   the warranty void. Though in my humble opinion this isn't legal or at
   least not fair. Always have a backup of both the original configuration
   and your Linux installation if you have to get your laptop repaired.

   ), I declare: If certain words are trademarks, the context should make it
   clear to whom they belong. For example "MS Windows NT" implies that
   "Windows NT" belongs to Microsoft (MS). "Mac" is a trademark by Apple
   Computer. Many of the designations used by manufacturers and sellers to
   distinguish their products are claimed as trademarks. Where those
   designations appear in this book, and I was aware of a trademark claim,
   the designations have been printed in caps or initial caps. All
   trademarks belong to their respective owners.
