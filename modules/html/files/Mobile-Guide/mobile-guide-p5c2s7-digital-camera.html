   are also some auxiliary programs for conversion of pictures, etc.

   file allows you to mount the device correctly. i.e.:

   I tried without it and it didn't work. Somehow the mount I got seems
   buggy . And if <B

>ro</B

   recognize back the memory stick and it needs to be msdos-formatted.

   is a library and utility program for cameras such as the Kodak
   DC-220, DC-260, DC-265, and DC-280, that run Flashpoint's Digita
   operating system. The library is a unix implementation of the
   Digita Host Interface Specification, intended for embedding
   Digita support in other products such as
   <B
CLASS="command"
>gPhoto</B

   program for standalone downloading of photos from the cameras.

   enables you to take a photo from any digital camera, load it
   onto your PC running a free operating system like GNU/Linux,
   print it, email it, put it on your web site, save it on your
   storage media in popular graphics formats or just view it on
   your monitor. <B

>gPhoto</B
> sports a new HTML
   engine that allows the creation of gallery themes (HTML
   templates with special tags) making publishing images to the
   world wide web a snap. A directory browse mode is implemented
   making it easy to create an HTML gallery from images already on
   your computer. Support for the Canon PowerShot A50, Kodak
   DC-240/280 USB, and Mustek MDC-800 digital cameras.

   is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate
   digital still cameras based on Fujitsu chipset and Siarra
   Imaging firmware. The program is known to work with Agfa,
   Epson and Olympus cameras. Should also work with Sanyo, but
   this is untested. The cameras typically come with software
   for Windows and for Mac, and no description of the protocol.
   With this tool, they are manageable from a
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>UNIX</SPAN
> box. Bruce D. Lightner
   &#60;lightner_AT_metaflow.com&#62; has added support for
   Win32 and DOS platforms. Note that the program does not
   have any GUI, it is plain command-line even on Windows.
   For a GUI, check out the <B

>phototk</B

   program.

   is software to convert .kdc images from Kodak's DC120
   digital camera to .tiff or .jpg files. This software pays
   particular attention to aspect ratio, high quality
   scaling, contrast adjustment, gamma correction, and image
