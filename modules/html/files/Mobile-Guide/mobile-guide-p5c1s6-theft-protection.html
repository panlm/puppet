>&#13;   Laptop lock: Almost all (if not all) of the new laptops come with a slot
   for the lock, and if yours doesn't have one, most locks come with a kit
   to add a slot.  One of Targus' Defcon locks even has a motion sensor,
   so you don't have to lock it up to a secure place, if you don't have
   one around.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The only drawback that I can think of is that it takes a couple extra
   seconds to set up or pack up your laptop.  It takes about 30 seconds to
   snap into place and makes it impossible to quickly walk away with the
   laptop. It won't stop a determined thief with the time to unscrew the
   legs of the desk or one that wanders around with a substantial pair of
   wire cutters in hand, but I feel pretty secure leaving the laptop on my
   desk while I go to meetings or lunch.

>&#13;   Name plates: to reduce the possibility of theft, you may want to have a
   nameplate (name, phone, e-mail, address) made and affixed to the cover
   of the laptop. A nice one will cost you about $12, and can be made by
   any good trophy shop. They'll glue it on for you too. You could use
   double-sided tape instead, but glue is more permanent. So it's easy to
   return, but will look beaten and abused if these are removed. You may
   even make an engravement into the laptop cover (inside). And even better
   into every removable part (hard disk, battery, CD/DVD drive, power
   unit).  If this machine ever gets to a repair office, I might get the
   machine back.  Make sure you remember to update the plates if you move.
</P
><P
>&#13;   If you don't mind marking up a piece of equipment worth several thousand
   dollars, make sure your laptop has some distinguishing feature that is
   easily recognizable, e.g. a bunch of stickers pasted on it.  Not only
   does it make your laptop easier to recognize, my guess is that people
   would be less likely to steal it.
</P
><P
>&#13;   It might even be useful to have a sticker that clearly says <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Does
   Not Run Windows"</SPAN
>. This is at least an argument for having your
   bootloader stop at the bootloader prompt, rather than mosey onwards into
   a colorful XDM login.

>&#13;   Link <B

   about setting a system such as when the laptop is unused for a while,
   instead of using normal apm service and suspend the machine, makes it
   run an xlock, disable the apm services in a way such that they do not
   suspend the machine automatically and start a 'laptop-protection
   daemon'. When the xlock disappears, the daemon is stopped and the apm
   services are restarted (so you might use the apm services yourself).
</P
><P
>&#13;   In the case somebody unplugs the machine while under the xlock (without
   giving the password), then the daemon would detect it and could start
   doing some preventive action, such as:
   - playing a sound with maximum volume saying "I am getting stolen".
   - this daemon could also register to a fixed local server and do a ping
   every now and then. If the ping stops before the daemon unregister to
   the server, then server then can take other actions, such as sending
   SMS message, starting a video camera, in the room, etc.  The apm
   services down would make the stealer unable to use the hot keys to
   suspend/stop the machine, isn't it?

   For IBM ThinkPads there is a dedicated DOS utility for burning

>&#13;   Boot loader: a boot loader may be used to put your name and phone number
   (or whatever text you choose) into the boot sequence before the
   operating system is loaded. This provides a label that can't be removed
   by editing files or even doing a simple format of the harddisk. Some
   boot loaders (e.g. LILO) offer a password option, which is highly
   recommend (note without it's very easy to get root access).

>&#13;   Use of software that connects and identifies itself: As far as I know
   there was an old DOS utility that did something like this.  It embedded
   itself into the bootsector and upon a certain keycombination it would throw a
   serial number onto the screen and play an audio code through the speaker
   (in case th monitor was no longer usable for whatever reason).  You were
   supposed to register the serial number with the company that produced
   the utility.

>&#13;   The laptop can send a mail with its real IP address if connected (mail
   with a print of <B

><P
>&#13;   Always remove the external devices and secure them in another
   place/room. Set the BIOS to boot on the hard disk first as a default
   setting and remove boot on other devices if possible. Also try to plug
   the power supply in the least accessible plug. So if your machine get
   stolen in your office the 'quick way' (e.g. during a 5 sec. cigarette
   break), the stealer won't perhaps have time to get the power supply,
   neither the time to get the drives. Perhaps he/she will end up with a
   less useful laptop and you may recover it.
