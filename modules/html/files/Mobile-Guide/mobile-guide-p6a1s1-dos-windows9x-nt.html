>&#13;   There are a few reasons which might make it necessary to
   put Micorosoft DOS/Windows and Linux together on one laptop. Often the support for
   the flash ROM of <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> cards and modems is not
   available for Linux, or you have to retrieve hardware information, which
   is not visible with Linux, due to a lack of support by some hardware
   manufacturers. I'm not sure whether these tasks can be performed under an
   emulation like DOS-EMU, WINE or VMware.

>&#13;   If you want Linux with X11, Netscape, etc., and
   Microsoft-Windows9x,NT,2000,XP things will be tight in a 1GB harddisk. 
   Though I did so with a 810MB disk.

>&#13;   Often you get a preinstalled version of Microsoft-Windows on your laptop. If you
   just want to shrink the Windows partition, you need a tool to resize
   the partition. Or you can remove the partition first, repartition, then
   reinstall. Most of the following information I found at the page of

>&#13;   One more "newer" utility for repartitioning and resizing FAT partitions
   is <EM

>A.1.3. Partition Sharing</H2
><P
>&#13;You may share your swap space between Linux and Windows. Please see "Dealing with Limited Resources" section.
</P
><P
>&#13;   With Linux you can mount any kind of DOS/Windows partition of the type
   <B
CLASS="command"
>msdos</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>vfat</B
> and even compressed
   drives (Drivespace, etc.). For long file names use
   <B
CLASS="command"
>vfat</B
> and if you like autoconversion ( a nice feature
   for text files), you may do so by using the <B
CLASS="command"
>conv=auto</B
>
   option. I have used this in my <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/fstab</TT
>, but
   be aware this might cause some strange behaviour sometimes, look at
   the kernel docs for further details.

   those who still have it) for accessing files on Linux harddisks (Linux's
   native Extended 2 filesystem).
</P
><P
>&#13;   The tools allow to list directories, to copy files from Linux to DOS and
   to copy files from DOS to Linux. You also can delete files or modify
   access rights of Linux files from DOS/Windows.
</P
><P
>&#13;   In combination with an included simple server program, you can also
   access your files from a remote client over the net (however, this might
   be a security risk, as access protection in this case is rather simple).

>PoPToP</A
>
   is the PPTP server solution for Linux allowing Linux servers to function
   seamlessly in the PPTP VPN environment. This enables administrators to
   leverage the considerable benefits of both Microsoft clients and Linux
   servers. The current pre-release version supports Windows 95/98/NT PPTP
   clients and PPTP Linux clients. The PoPToP pre-release server is not yet
   fully optimised. On release, PoPToP will be fully compliant with IETF
   PPTP Internet Draft and it will seamlessly support Windows PPTP clients
   with the full range of encryption and authentication features.
