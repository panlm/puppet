   Asymmetric tools are good only when you can respect a strict discipline,
   when you switch from one machine to another. On the contrary, tools like
   CVS are more forgetful.

>unison</A
>
   is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and
   Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories
   to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
   modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
   changes in each replica to the other.
   Unison was written by researchers with an eye for well-defined
   replication semantics: they were very fussy about safety, and made
   sure to handle gracefully things like premature termination etc.
   Unison is symmetric/bidirectional (unlike rsync), works fine with
   binaries (unlike cvs), and is a user-level program (unlike most
   distributed filesystems).  It also makes a reasonable attempt to
   synchronize transparently between Unix/Linux and Windows filesystems,
   which is no small feat.  Drawbacks: it does not do version control,
   and does not handle synchronization among more than 2 file trees.

   commodity handsets.
   
   Funambol is also a software development platform for mobile applications. It
   provides client and server side Java APIs, and facilitates the development,
   deployment and management of any mobile project. Funambol is the de facto
   standard implementation of the Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronization and
   Device Management protocols (OMA DS and DM, formerly known as SyncML).
   Funambol is replaces the former sync4J tools.

   is a new distributed file system with a focus on
   high availability.  InterMezzo is an Open Source
   project, currently on Linux (2.2 and 2.3).  A
   primary target of development is to provide
   support for flexible replication of directories,
   with disconnected operation and a persistent
   cache.  For example, we want to make it easy to
   manage copies of home directories on multiple
   computers, and solve the laptop/desktop
   synchronization problems. On a larger scale we aim
   to provide replication of large file repositories,
   for example to support high availability for
   servers.  InterMezzo was deeply inspired
   by the Coda File System, but totally
   re-designed and re-engineered.

><P
>&#13;   Xfiles is an interactive utility for comparing and merging one file tree

   machines (no need to keep track of what files are changed on which
   machine). Xfiles can also be used as a cross-validating disk &#60;-&#62;
   disk backup strategy (portions of a disk may go bad at any time, with no
   simple indication of which files were affected. Cross-validate against a
   second disk before backup to make sure you aren't backing up bad data).
</P
><P
>&#13;   A client/server program (GUI on the client) traverses a file tree and
   reports any files that are missing on the server machine, missing on the
   client machine, or different. For each such file, the file size/sizes and
   modification date(s) are shown, and a comparison (using
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>UNIX</SPAN
> diff) can be obtained. For files that are missing
   from one tree, <EM
>similarly named</EM
> files in that tree
   are reported. Inconsistent files can then be copied in either direction
   or deleted on either machine. The file trees do not need to be accessible
   via nfs. Files checksums are computed in parallel, so largely similar
   trees can be compared over a slow network link. The client and server
   processes can also be run on the same machine. File selection and
   interaction with a revision control system such as RCS can be handled by
   scripting using jpython. Requirements Java1.1 or later and JFC/Swing1.1
   are needed.
