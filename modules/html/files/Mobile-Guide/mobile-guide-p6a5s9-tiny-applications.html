   <B
CLASS="command"
>boa</B
> is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that
   unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
   connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
   connections. It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP
   connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
   processes.) Preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several
   hundred hits per second on a 100 MHz Pentium."

   is the alternative most people prefer. These systems act as proxy X11
   servers and compress datastreams by well over 50 percent for normal
   requests, often reaching a reduction to 25 percent of the original
   bandwidth usage. With dxpc, X Windows applications are quite usable
   over a 28.8 modem link or across the Internet."

   such popular packages as Window Maker, Enlightenment, and FVWM2.
   You might be interested in this package if you are tired of window
   managers that are a heavy drain on your system resources, but you
   still want an attractive and modern-looking interface."

    :"It's a GUI, GUI, GUI, GUI world! " -- or so the
   major OS manufacturers would have you belief. Truth is, that while this
   is increasingly the case, there are times when the command line interface
   (CLI) is still a very good choice for getting things done. It's fast,
   generally efficient, and is a good choice on memory or CPU constrained
   machines. And don't forget that there are still a lot of very nifty
   things that can be done <EM
